# ECC-AES-on-Speech-Signals
The proposed method encrypts .wav files and evaluates the performance of different encryption algorithms, including AES, Data Encryption Standard (DES), and Triple DES. The encryption performance is evaluated based on parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), time for encryption/decryption and Short Term Objective Intelligibility.
